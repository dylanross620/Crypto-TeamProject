	In our assigned project, all variables used for public key cryptography are stored in the \texttt{sshConstants.h} file. This allows both the ATM and the bank to have access to the public
	variables required for the signatures and verifications to work properly without much hassle. However, due to the open-source nature of the project, this also allows attackers to read the
	private keys as well. This issue could have been avoided by having the private keys be in a file that represented local storage on the bank and/or the ATM as oppossed to hard-coded.\\

	As a result of this vulnerability, an attacker can sign messages as the bank and therefore setup an authenticated ssh session with an atm. Furthermore, this false bank can approve all
	withdraw requests sent by the atm, allowing the attacker to withdraw as much money as they would like regardless of their balance.
